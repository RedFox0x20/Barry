The Bit Array Esoteric programming language.
A ridiculous litte project I did for fun, creating an interpreter that performs
logical and arithmetic operations on a series of bytes where _most_ of the
operations performed are logical within a single byte, some are arithmetic
across 3 bytes.

A game of memory management and stupidity. Methods were added to make writing
useful code in this easier however it's not easy to get anything truly useful!
Definately try out other Esoteric languages that are much more complete.
